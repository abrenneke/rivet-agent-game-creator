# Game Improvement Ideas

Here are some ideas to improve our existing game where the user controls a bouncing ball:

## Objectives

1. **Collecting Items:** The game could generate periodic items - like stars or coins - at different locations within the frame that the player needs to collect by bouncing the ball into them. Each collected item could increase the score.

2. **Hitting Multiple Targets:** The game could give users targets, like balloons or bricks, that they have to hit with the bouncing ball. Targets could be color-coded to represent different difficulty levels (and thus differ in the number of points they offer).

## Scoring Mechanics

1. **Time-Based Scoring:** The longer the user can keep the ball bouncing without it leaving the frame or hitting a dangerous object, the more points they collect.

2. **Combo Hits:** If the user hits multiple targets in a short time period or hits the same targets continuously, they get bonus points.

## Art Improvement

To make the game visually appealing, the design of the bouncing ball, items, targets, and frame can be enhanced. Use vibrant colors and unique shapes which are attractive to users.

## Special Power-ups

Introduce power-ups that users can collect to gain certain abilities for a short time. For example, a magnet power-up could attract nearby items, or a shield could protect the ball from dangerous objects.
