Title: 2D Bouncing Ball Game

## Game Structure

The game is structured as a simple 2D bouncing ball game. The main element of the game is a ball that moves automatically based on its velocity properties (`dx` and `dy`), which represent the ball's movement in the X and Y directions respectively.

## Game Functionality

The game involves various targets, each with its own properties and effects. These targets can potentially serve as power-ups or power-downs, providing an element of strategy and unpredictability to the game. Players must navigate the ball to hit these targets and gain their effects.

## Scoring System

The scoring system is currently not fully defined. However, there is a `score` variable initialized to 0, and a function `updateScore()` that updates the score display on the webpage. As the game develops, the scoring system will be further defined to provide a clear objective for players.

## Current State

Currently, the game has a basic structure and functionality in place, with a ball that moves automatically and targets with various properties and effects. The scoring system is still under development. The game is in a state of continuous improvement and expansion, with further details and functionalities to be added as it evolves.
