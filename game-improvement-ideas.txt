The following are the ideas for improving the game:

1. Introduce different kinds of immovable or moving targets in the game with different point values and effects.
2. Introduce levels with a set of targets that players need to hit to progress to the next level.
3. Introduce special, time-limited items which provide bonus points or extra abilities temporarily.
4. Implement score multipliers for hitting targets in quick succession or a specific pattern.
5. Add enemy elements or obstacles that cause the player to lose points or end the game.

There is also a suggestion to experiment with themes for the game's art, such as depicting the ball as a spacecraft and the targets as planets or celestial elements.
